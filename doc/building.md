This repository uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for some of its dependencies. To make sure submodules are restored or updated, be sure to run the following prior to building:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

OpenConsole.sln may be built from within Visual Studio or from the command-line using a set of convenience scripts & tools in the **/tools** directory:

When using Visual Studio, be sure to set up the path for code formatting. This can be done in Visual Studio by going to Tools > Options > Text Editor > C++ > Formatting and checking "Use custom clang-format.exe file" and choosing the clang-format.exe in the repository at /dep/llvm/clang-format.exe by clicking "browse" right under the check box.

### Building in PowerShell

```powershell
Import-Module .\tools\OpenConsole.psm1
Set-MsBuildDevEnvironment
Invoke-OpenConsoleBuild
```

There are a few additional exported functions (look at their documentation for further details):

- `Invoke-OpenConsoleBuild` - builds the solution. Can be passed msbuild arguments.
- `Invoke-OpenConsoleTests` - runs the various tests. Will run the unit tests by default.
- `Start-OpenConsole` - starts Openconsole.exe from the output directory. x64 is run by default.
- `Debug-OpenConsole` - starts Openconsole.exe and attaches it to the default debugger. x64 is run by default.
- `Invoke-CodeFormat` - uses clang-format to format all c++ files to match our coding style.

### Building in Cmd

```shell
.\tools\razzle.cmd
bcz
```

There are also scripts for running the tests:
- `runut.cmd` - run the unit tests
- `runft.cmd` - run the feature tests
- `runuia.cmd` - run the UIA tests
- `runformat` - uses clang-format to format all c++ files to match our coding style.

## Running & Debugging

To debug the Windows Terminal in VS, right click on `CascadiaPackage` (in the Solution Explorer) and go to properties. In the Debug menu, change "Application process" and "Background task process" to "Native Only".

You should then be able to build & debug the Terminal project by hitting <kbd>F5</kbd>.

> ðŸ‘‰ You will _not_ be able to launch the Terminal directly by running the WindowsTerminal.exe. For more details on why, see [#926](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/926), [#4043](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/4043)

## Configuration Types

Openconsole has three configuration types:

- Debug
- Release
- AuditMode

AuditMode is an experimental mode that enables some additional static analysis from CppCoreCheck.
